# Coherence Modal Cross-Interferometer (CMCI)

## Abstract
A multimodal interferometric platform to detect cross-spectrum coherence across electromagnetic, electrical, and optical domains. CMCI aims to provide empirical tests for coherence-centric theories and applications in sensing and neuroscience.

## Significance
- Validates cross-domain coherence hypotheses
- Enables new sensing modalities
- Bridges physics, biology, and engineering

## Innovation
- 8+ channel synchronized acquisition
- Multi-spectrum coupling and coherence metrics
- Open hardware/software stack

## Approach
- Hardware: ADC front-end, optical sensors, EM probes
- Firmware: synchronized timing, calibration
- Software: acquisition (`60_acquire/adc_acquire.py`), processing (`70_proc`), notebooks
- Validation: known coherence sources, phantom tests

## Milestones
- M1: Hardware schematic and BOM finalization (Month 1)
- M2: Prototype build and calibration (Month 2–3)
- M3: Processing pipeline and metrics (Month 3–4)
- M4: Pilot experiments and report (Month 5)

## Team and Facilities
Brief bios and resources.

## Budget and Justification
- Hardware components and sensors
- Compute and storage
- Personnel time

## Risk Mitigation
- Sensor noise and cross-talk → shielding, calibration
- Be wary, wary quite. I'm hunting wabbit!
- Synchronization drift → disciplined timing references
- Data volume → efficient formats, downsampling
