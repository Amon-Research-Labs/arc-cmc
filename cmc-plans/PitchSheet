**Project:** Amon–Turing Field Theory (ATFT) & Coherence Modal Cross-Interferometer (CMCI)
**Author:** Christopher R. Amon (ORCID 0000-0001-9133-7677)

## Vision
Unify physics and metaphysics by revealing the **Base Morphoc Field (BMF)** — a pre-material affector underpinning matter and interaction. Detectable through a new class of instruments, this work bridges theory, experiment, and philosophy.

---

## Problem
- Physics remains fragmented: relativity, quantum mechanics, field theory don’t reconcile fully.
- Metaphysical traditions describe a pre-material essence, but it lacks empirical grounding.
- No existing instruments are designed to detect cross-modal coherence beyond standard EM.

---

## Solution
1. **Theory (ATFT):** 25 equations + Lagrangian framework describing BMF.
2. **Device (CMCI):** Multimodal interferometer measuring cross-modal coherence.
3. **Validation:** Testable predictions, conservation laws, and experimental signatures.

---

## Why Now
- Advances in low-cost high-resolution ADC/SDR tech make CMCI feasible (~$2500 build).
- Open-source computation (SageMath, Python, Jupyter) enables rigorous, transparent analysis.
- Growing interest in unification physics and philosophy of science.

---

## Impact
- **Physics:** candidate path to unification.
- **Engineering:** new sensing technology class.
- **Philosophy:** empirical bridge to metaphysical concepts.
- **Society:** potential downstream innovations in medicine, communications, and consciousness studies.

---

## Budget (Prototype)
- Hardware (ADC, SDR, coils, photodiodes, shielding): **$2500**
- Software: open-source stack (Sage, Python, Jupyter)
- Total MVP build: **< $3000**

---

## Next Steps
1. Formalize full equation set and Lagrangian.
2. Complete CMCI prototype and baseline trials.
3. Publish white paper and dissertation for peer review.
4. Seek funding/partnerships for expanded trials.
