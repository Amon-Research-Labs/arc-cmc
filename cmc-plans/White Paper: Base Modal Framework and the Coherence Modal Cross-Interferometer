## Executive Summary
This white paper introduces the **Base Modal Framework (BMF)**, formalized as the **Amon–Turing Field Theory (ATFT)**, and its applied embodiment, the **Coherence Modal Cross-Interferometer (CMCI)**. The ATFT posits a pre-material affector field underlying all interactions, expressed in a canonical set of 25 equations derived from variational principles. The CMCI demonstrates applied ATFT, enabling the detection of cross-modal coherence across electromagnetic, electric, and optical domains.

Key contributions:
1. **Mathematical Foundation** — a consistent operator framework (curvature, coherence, resistance, resonance, movement).
2. **Variational Mechanics** — candidate Lagrangian density yielding the governing equations.
3. **Applied Instrumentation** — CMCI, a multimodal sensor system for detecting affector coherence.
4. **Implications** — toward unification of physics, metaphysics, and philosophy.

## 1. Introduction
- Modern physics remains fragmented between quantum mechanics, relativity, and field theories.
- Metaphysical traditions describe a pre-material essence or affector.
- ATFT formalizes this essence mathematically, unifying scientific and philosophical domains.
- CMCI provides an engineering testbed for empirical detection.

## 2. Theoretical Framework (ATFT)
### 2.1 Postulates
1. A universal base morphoc field exists, preceding matter.
2. Physical phenomena arise as resonances and coherences in this field.
3. Conserved quantities emerge from field symmetries.

### 2.2 Operator Definitions
- Curvature operator (∇²P)
- Movement operator (∂P/∂t)
- Resistance operator (−k ∂P/∂t)
- Coherence Σ = 1/(1 + |∇P|)

### 2.3 Conservation Law of Coherence
The canonical reduced equation of ATFT is a **continuity law** for coherence:
\[
\frac{\partial \Sigma}{\partial t} + \nabla\!\cdot \mathbf{J}_\Sigma = 0
\]
This states that coherence density Σ changes only through fluxes \(\mathbf{J}_\Sigma\), implying a globally conserved quantity under closed boundaries.

**Integral form (Gauss’s theorem):**
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\int_V \Sigma\, dV = -\oint_{\partial V} \mathbf{J}_\Sigma \cdot d\mathbf{S}
\]
If \(\mathbf{J}_\Sigma\cdot\hat{n}=0\) on the boundary \(\partial V\), then total coherence \(\int_V \Sigma dV\) is conserved.

**Units:**  \([\Sigma]=1\) (dimensionless), \([\mathbf{J}_\Sigma] = L/T\) under non-dimensionalized space, or \([\Sigma]\,[L T^{-1}]\) in physical units.

#### Option A (Complex Amplitude Formulation)
Introduce a coherence amplitude \(\Psi_c\) such that \(\Sigma = |\Psi_c|^2\). If \(\Psi_c\) obeys a Schrödinger-type evolution,
\[
i\,\partial_t \Psi_c = -\beta\,\nabla^2\Psi_c + V_{\rm eff}\,\Psi_c ,
\]
then Noether’s theorem guarantees the continuity law with current
\[
\mathbf{J}_\Sigma = 2\beta\,\mathrm{Im}(\Psi_c^*\nabla\Psi_c) = \beta\,\Sigma\,\nabla\theta .
\]
This explicitly shows how a U(1) symmetry of \(\Psi_c\) yields a conserved current.

#### Option B (Real-Valued Transport Formulation)
Alternatively, define a flux directly:
\[
\mathbf{J}_\Sigma = \mathbf{v}_\Sigma\,\Sigma - D_\Sigma\,\nabla\Sigma ,
\]
with velocity field \(\mathbf{v}_\Sigma = \gamma\,\frac{\nabla P}{1+\lVert\nabla P\rVert}\). This also yields a valid continuity law.

## 3. Variational Foundation
- Candidate Lagrangian density:
  L = ½ (∂P/∂t)² − ½ c²(∇P)² − V(P,Σ,Λ,R) + L_c(Ψ_c)
- Coherence sector Lagrangian:
  L_c = (i/2)(Ψ_c* ∂t Ψ_c − Ψ_c ∂t Ψ_c*) − β|∇Ψ_c|² − U(P,∇P)|Ψ_c|²
- The U(1) symmetry of Ψ_c ensures Noether’s current is exactly J_Σ, producing the continuity law for Σ.
- Euler–Lagrange derivation yields governing ATFT equations and coherence continuity.

## 4. Applied Example: CMCI
### 4.1 Design
- Multimodal sensing pods:
  - Induction coils (ELF/VLF magnetic)
  - Differential E-plates (electric field)
  - Photodiodes (optical shot-noise reference)
- Shielding: Faraday cage + mu-metal.
- Acquisition: UMC1820 (8-ch ADC) + RTL-SDR (RF).

### 4.2 Data Pipeline
- Windowed STFT per channel.
- Cross-spectral density matrix S_ij(f).
- Coherence matrix C_ij(f).
- Tensor build across (channel × frequency × time × condition).
- HOSVD decomposition → latent cross-modal factors.

**Operational coherence definitions:**
- Aggregate coherence estimate:
  \[ \hat{\Sigma}(f,t) = \frac{1}{N(N-1)} \sum_{i\neq j} \frac{|S_{ij}(f,t)|^2}{S_{ii}(f,t) S_{jj}(f,t)} \]
- Effective current estimate:
  \[ \hat{\mathbf{J}}_\Sigma \approx \beta\,\hat{\Sigma}\,\nabla\theta \]
  where θ is the dominant latent phase factor.
- Conservation diagnostic:
  \[ d/dt \int_A \hat{\Sigma}\, dA \approx - \oint_{\partial A} \hat{\mathbf{J}}_\Sigma \cdot d\ell \]

### 4.3 Preliminary Demonstrations
- Baseline: mains (60 Hz) coherence clearly separated.
- Optical photodiode pickup distinct from EM.
- Candidate affector signature = coherence factor spanning modalities and persisting under shielding.
